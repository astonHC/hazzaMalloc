# hazzaMalloc

Recreational Memory Allocator to learn about Stacks, Queues and Hashmaps

# Motive:

As it says on the tin, this project aims to provide me with the study material to be able to understand the following Data Structures on the basis of how they work in relation to the Lowest level abstraction (except written in Java)

This involves making my own methods for allocating Blocks of Stack Memory, pushing data to said Blocks and evaluating their respective size.

# Building:

```
git clone this repository

javac *.java

java Main.java
```

The following output should be this:

Values are hard-coded in ``Main.java`` in order to provide an example of how and where values are being pushed onto the Stack
